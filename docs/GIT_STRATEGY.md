# Git Branching Strategy for Polyhedge Frontend

Guide to choosing the right git workflow for hackathon development while learning best practices.

## Your Proposed Strategy (Analysis)

### What You Suggested:
```
main
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FE-preview
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delete old packages
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/marketplace
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/purchase-flow
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/dashboard
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/wallet
           ‚Üì
      merge features back to FE-preview
           ‚Üì
      merge FE-preview to main (when done)
```

### Analysis: This is Actually GREAT Thinking! üéØ

**Why your logic is solid**:
1. ‚úÖ **Isolation** - FE work doesn't affect main branch
2. ‚úÖ **Safety** - Can delete old packages without breaking main
3. ‚úÖ **Organization** - Each feature gets its own branch
4. ‚úÖ **Learning** - You'll learn proper git workflows
5. ‚úÖ **Rollback** - Easy to undo if something breaks

**Potential challenges**:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Time overhead** - Managing multiple branches takes time
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Merge conflicts** - More branches = more potential conflicts
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Context switching** - Jumping between branches can be confusing
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Hackathon pace** - Under time pressure, simpler might be better

## Strategy Options (Compared)

### Option A: Your Proposed Strategy (Feature Branches)
**Best for**: Learning proper git workflows, team collaboration

```bash
# Current state
* fe-contract-docs (your current branch with docs)

# Create FE-preview from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b FE-preview

# Cherry-pick your doc commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-docs>

# Delete old packages (optional)
rm -rf packages/nextjs packages/vincent-login
git add -A
git commit -m "cleanup: remove old frontend packages"

# Create feature branches
git checkout -b feature/sidebar-layout
# ... work ...
git checkout FE-preview
git merge feature/sidebar-layout

git checkout -b feature/marketplace
# ... work ...
git checkout FE-preview
git merge feature/marketplace

# And so on...
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of features
- ‚úÖ Easy to review individual features
- ‚úÖ Can abandon a feature without affecting others
- ‚úÖ Industry best practice
- ‚úÖ Great for learning

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå More git commands to remember
- ‚ùå Potential merge conflicts when merging features
- ‚ùå Time overhead in hackathon setting
- ‚ùå Can be overwhelming when learning both React + Git

**Time cost**: +10-15% overhead for branch management

---

### Option B: Single Development Branch (Simpler)
**Best for**: Solo development, hackathons, rapid iteration

```bash
# Current state
* fe-contract-docs (has your docs)

# Rename to something more appropriate
git branch -m fe-contract-docs fe-development

# Build everything on this one branch
# No feature branches, just commit directly
git add packages/app
git commit -m "feat: add marketplace table"

git add packages/app
git commit -m "feat: add purchase dialog"

# When ready, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge fe-development
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Simple - no branch juggling
- ‚úÖ Fast - just code and commit
- ‚úÖ Linear history - easy to follow
- ‚úÖ Less context switching
- ‚úÖ Focus on learning React, not Git

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå All changes mixed together
- ‚ùå Harder to isolate if something breaks
- ‚ùå Can't easily throw away experimental code
- ‚ùå Less "real-world" workflow

**Time cost**: Minimal overhead

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for You!)
**Best for**: Balancing learning with hackathon speed

```bash
# Start with single branch
git checkout -b FE-preview

# Build features directly on FE-preview initially
git commit -m "feat: setup packages/app with shadcn"
git commit -m "feat: add sidebar layout"
git commit -m "feat: add marketplace table"

# Create feature branch ONLY for risky/experimental work
git checkout -b experiment/complex-chart
# Try something...
# If it works:
git checkout FE-preview
git merge experiment/complex-chart
# If it doesn't work:
git checkout FE-preview
git branch -D experiment/complex-chart  # Delete it!

# When ready, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge FE-preview
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Simple for most work
- ‚úÖ Flexibility for experiments
- ‚úÖ Safety net when needed
- ‚úÖ Balance of speed + learning
- ‚úÖ Can switch to full feature branches later

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Not as clean as full feature branches
- ‚ùå Still some overhead

**Time cost**: +5% overhead (only when needed)

## Recommendation for Polyhedge Hackathon

### üèÜ Go with **Option C: Hybrid Approach**

Here's why:

1. **You're learning TWO things** - React/Next.js AND Git
2. **Time pressure** - Hackathons have deadlines
3. **Solo development** - Not dealing with merge conflicts from teammates
4. **Flexibility** - Can always create feature branches if needed
5. **Best of both worlds** - Simple by default, branches when useful

### Concrete Plan for Your Project

#### Phase 1: Setup & Cleanup (now)
```bash
# You're on: fe-contract-docs
# This branch has: docs commits

# Create FE-preview from current branch
git checkout -b FE-preview

# Optional: Delete old packages now or later
# (I'd say keep them for now, delete later if needed)

# Commit any changes
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: update plan with sidebar layout"
```

#### Phase 2: Build Core Features (next)
```bash
# Work directly on FE-preview
git add packages/app
git commit -m "feat: initialize packages/app with Next.js and shadcn"

git add packages/app/components/layout
git commit -m "feat: add sidebar layout with navigation"

git add packages/app/app/strategies
git commit -m "feat: add marketplace table with strategy data"

git add packages/app/components/strategies
git commit -m "feat: add buy strategy dialog and USDC approval"

git add packages/app/app/dashboard
git commit -m "feat: add user dashboard with positions table"
```

#### Phase 3: Use Feature Branches for Experiments
```bash
# Only when trying something risky/uncertain
git checkout -b experiment/animated-charts
# Try adding fancy charts...
# If it works, merge back
git checkout FE-preview
git merge experiment/animated-charts

# If it doesn't work or takes too long
git checkout FE-preview
git branch -D experiment/animated-charts  # Delete and move on
```

#### Phase 4: Polish & Merge to Main
```bash
# When ready to deploy/present
git checkout main
git merge FE-preview

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Detailed Workflow: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Create FE-Preview Branch (Right Now)

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Make sure everything is committed
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: finalize planning documents"

# Create FE-preview from current branch
git checkout -b FE-preview

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
# Should show: * FE-preview
```

### Step 2: Optional Cleanup

**Option A: Delete old packages now**
```bash
# Remove old frontend packages
git rm -rf packages/nextjs
git rm -rf packages/vincent-login
git commit -m "cleanup: remove old frontend packages for fresh start"
```

**Option B: Keep them for now** (Recommended)
```bash
# Just create packages/app alongside them
# Can delete later if they're in the way
# Nice to keep as reference
```

### Step 3: Set Up New Package

```bash
# Create and initialize packages/app
mkdir -p packages/app
cd packages/app
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app

# Commit the new package
git add packages/app
git commit -m "feat: initialize packages/app with Next.js 15"

# Initialize shadcn
cd packages/app
npx shadcn@latest init
# Answer prompts...

# Commit shadcn setup
git add packages/app
git commit -m "feat: initialize shadcn/ui with default config"
```

### Step 4: Build Features (Commit Often!)

**Good commit cadence**: Every 30-60 minutes or when you complete a "unit" of work

```bash
# After creating sidebar layout
git add packages/app/components/layout
git commit -m "feat(layout): add sidebar navigation with Polyhedge branding"

# After creating marketplace table
git add packages/app/app/strategies
git add packages/app/components/strategies
git commit -m "feat(strategies): add marketplace table with strategy data"

# After adding buy dialog
git add packages/app/components/strategies/BuyStrategyDialog.tsx
git commit -m "feat(strategies): add buy dialog with USDC approval flow"
```

### Step 5: When Ready, Merge to Main

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge FE-preview
git merge FE-preview

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Push FE-preview branch too (backup)
git push origin FE-preview
```

---

## Common Git Commands You'll Use

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Check what's changed
git status

# See your changes
git diff

# Add files
git add packages/app/components/NewComponent.tsx
# or add everything
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: add new component"

# See commit history
git log --oneline -10

# Push to GitHub
git push origin FE-preview
```

### When Something Goes Wrong

```bash
# Undo changes to a file (before commit)
git checkout -- packages/app/components/BrokenComponent.tsx

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes) ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGEROUS
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# See what you changed in last commit
git show

# Create a commit that undoes a previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Branching Commands

```bash
# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-thing

# Switch branches
git checkout FE-preview

# List all branches
git branch -a

# Delete branch (safe - won't delete if unmerged)
git branch -d feature/old-thing

# Delete branch (force - will delete even if unmerged)
git branch -D experiment/failed-thing

# Merge branch into current branch
git merge feature/new-thing
```

## Commit Message Best Practices

### Format
```
type(scope): short description

Longer explanation if needed
- Bullet points for details
- What changed and why
```

### Types
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting (not CSS)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance (dependencies, config)

### Examples

**Good commits**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(marketplace): add strategy table with sorting"
git commit -m "feat(purchase): implement USDC approval flow"
git commit -m "fix(dashboard): correct P&L calculation for settled strategies"
git commit -m "style(sidebar): improve mobile responsiveness"
git commit -m "docs: update README with deployment instructions"
```

**Bad commits** (too vague):
```bash
git commit -m "update stuff"
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "wip"
```

---

## Handling Merge Conflicts (If They Happen)

### When You See a Merge Conflict

```bash
# Try to merge
git merge feature/something

# If conflict occurs:
Auto-merging packages/app/components/Something.tsx
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in packages/app/components/Something.tsx
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

### Resolve It

1. **Open the conflicted file** - You'll see:
```typescript
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your current code
const value = "A";
=======
// Incoming code from feature branch
const value = "B";
>>>>>>> feature/something
```

2. **Edit the file** - Keep what you want:
```typescript
// Choose one or combine both
const value = "B";
```

3. **Mark as resolved**:
```bash
git add packages/app/components/Something.tsx
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflict in Something component"
```

### Pro Tip: Use VS Code
VS Code has built-in merge conflict resolution UI - super helpful!

## Quick Decision Matrix

Choose your strategy based on:

| Your Situation | Recommended Strategy |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Solo developer, tight deadline | **Option B: Single Branch** |
| Solo developer, learning focus | **Option C: Hybrid** (üëà **YOU**) |
| Team of 2-3, hackathon | **Option C: Hybrid** |
| Team of 4+, hackathon | **Option A: Feature Branches** |
| Production app, multiple developers | **Option A: Feature Branches** |

---

## Final Recommendation for You

### Do This:

1. **Right now**: Create `FE-preview` branch from `fe-contract-docs`
2. **Keep old packages**: Don't delete yet (can reference later)
3. **Build on FE-preview**: Commit directly for most work
4. **Use feature branches**: Only for risky experiments
5. **Merge to main**: When ready to present/deploy

### Don't Do This:

1. ‚ùå Create feature branches for every tiny change
2. ‚ùå Worry too much about "perfect" git history
3. ‚ùå Stress about branching during hackathon
4. ‚ùå Delete old code until you're sure you don't need it

### Remember:

> "Perfect is the enemy of done" - especially in hackathons!

Git is a tool to help you, not slow you down. Use branches when they help, work directly when they don't.
