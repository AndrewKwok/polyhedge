# Position Closing Feature

## Overview

The bridge service now supports closing positions! This feature allows closing Polymarket bets and settling strategies on the blockchain contract.

## Flow

### Opening Position (Existing)
1. User calls `buyStrategy()` on StrategyManager contract
2. Contract emits `StrategyPurchased` event
3. Bridge service detects event via HyperSync
4. Service places BUY orders on Polymarket

### Closing Position (NEW!)
1. User/Admin calls API: `POST /api/strategies/:id/close`
2. Service closes all Polymarket positions (sells them)
3. Service calculates total payout
4. Service calls `settleStrategy()` on contract with payout rate
5. Users can now call `claimStrategy()` to receive their payout

## API Endpoint

### POST /api/strategies/:id/close

Close a strategy and settle it on-chain.

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/strategies/1/close \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Strategy matured"}'
```

**Request Body:**
```typescript
{
  reason?: string;  // Optional reason for closing
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "strategyId": "1",
  "totalPayout": "1080000",
  "payoutPerUSDC": "1080000",
  "transactionHash": "0xabc123...",
  "positions": [
    {
      "tokenId": "market-1",
      "side": "YES",
      "size": 100
    },
    {
      "tokenId": "market-2",
      "side": "NO",
      "size": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response (Error):**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to close position",
  "message": "Strategy 1 already settled"
}
```

## Components

### 1. PositionCloser Service

`src/services/position-closer.ts`

Main service that coordinates position closing:

```typescript
const closer = new PositionCloser(config);
const result = await closer.closePosition({
  strategyId: 1n,
  reason: "Maturity reached"
});
```

**Features:**
- Validates strategy exists and not already settled
- Closes all Polymarket positions for the strategy
- Calculates payout per USDC invested
- Calls contract `settleStrategy()` method
- Returns settlement result with transaction hash

### 2. Polymarket Client Enhancement

`src/polymarket/client.ts`

Added `closePosition()` method:

```typescript
const position = await polymarket.closePosition({
  tokenId: "market-id",
  side: "YES"
});
```

**How it works:**
- Sells the position (opposite side of original order)
- Uses FOK (Fill-or-Kill) order type
- Retries up to 3 times on failure
- Respects concurrency limits

### 3. Contract Integration

Uses ethers.js to interact with StrategyManager contract:

```solidity
function settleStrategy(
  uint256 strategyId, 
  uint256 payoutPerUSDC
) external onlyOwner
```

**Settlement Logic:**
1. Queries contract for strategy state (maturity, settled status)
2. Calculates `payoutPerUSDC` based on total payout from Polymarket
3. Calls `settleStrategy()` to mark strategy as settled
4. Users can then claim via `claimStrategy()`

## Types

### ClosePositionRequest
```typescript
interface ClosePositionRequest {
  strategyId: bigint;
  reason?: string;
}
```

### PolymarketPosition
```typescript
interface PolymarketPosition {
  tokenId: string;
  size: number;        // Amount of tokens sold
  side: 'YES' | 'NO';  // Original position side
}
```

### SettlementResult
```typescript
interface SettlementResult {
  strategyId: bigint;
  totalPayout: bigint;         // Total USDC received from Polymarket
  payoutPerUSDC: bigint;       // Payout rate (6 decimals)
  polymarketPositions: PolymarketPosition[];
  transactionHash?: string;    // Settlement tx hash
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Close a Strategy (API)
```bash
# Close strategy ID 1
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/strategies/1/close \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Maturity reached"}'
```

### Close a Strategy (Programmatic)
```typescript
import { PositionCloser } from './services/position-closer.js';

const closer = new PositionCloser(appConfig);

try {
  const result = await closer.closePosition({
    strategyId: 1n,
    reason: "Strategy matured"
  });

  console.log('Settlement successful!');
  console.log('TX Hash:', result.transactionHash);
  console.log('Payout rate:', result.payoutPerUSDC.toString());
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to close:', error.message);
}
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Contract address (for settlement)
STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x...

# RPC URLs
ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://...      # For contract interaction
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://...       # For Polymarket

# Private key (must have owner role on contract)
POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run position closing tests:
```bash
yarn test position-closer.test.ts
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Close all Polymarket positions
- ✅ Call settleStrategy on contract
- ✅ Return settlement result
- ✅ Handle unknown strategy error
- ✅ Handle already settled error  
- ✅ Handle Polymarket API errors
- ✅ Warn when closing before maturity

### Integration Test

```bash
# 1. Start service
yarn dev

# 2. Close a test strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/strategies/1/close

# 3. Check response
```

## Important Notes

### 🔒 Security
- Only owner can call `settleStrategy()` on contract
- Ensure `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` has owner role
- Consider adding API authentication in production

### 💡 Limitations (MVP)
1. **Position Size Tracking**: Currently uses placeholder value (100)
   - TODO: Query actual position size from Polymarket CLOB API
   - Or track position sizes in database

2. **Total Invested Tracking**: Currently uses placeholder
   - TODO: Sum `StrategyPurchased` events' `netAmount`
   - Or add to contract state

3. **No Partial Closes**: Must close entire strategy
   - TODO: Add support for partial position closes

4. **Manual Trigger**: Requires API call to close
   - TODO: Add automatic closing at maturity

### 📝 Production Considerations

1. **Position Tracking**:
   ```typescript
   // Implement proper position tracking
   const positions = await clobAPI.getPositions(walletAddress);
   const size = positions.find(p => p.tokenId === tokenId)?.size || 0;
   ```

2. **Investment Tracking**:
   ```typescript
   // Query events to get total invested
   const events = await contract.queryFilter('StrategyPurchased', fromBlock);
   const totalInvested = events
     .filter(e => e.args.strategyId === strategyId)
     .reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.args.netAmount, 0n);
   ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry logic for contract calls
   - Handle partial Polymarket closes gracefully
   - Add dead-letter queue for failed settlements

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Track settlement success/failure rates
   - Alert on position closing errors
   - Monitor payout calculations

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Strategy not found"
- Ensure strategy ID exists in `strategies.json`
- Check that strategy has been created on-chain

### Error: "already settled"
- Strategy can only be settled once
- Check settlement status: `await contract.strategies(strategyId)`

### Error: "Market closed"
- Polymarket position may not exist
- Check position exists before closing
- May occur if positions were manually closed

### Transaction Reverts
- Ensure wallet has owner role on contract
- Check strategy has reached maturity (if enforced)
- Verify sufficient gas and funds

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Automatic closing at maturity (cron job)
- [ ] Partial position closing
- [ ] Real-time position size tracking
- [ ] Settlement preview (dry-run mode)
- [ ] Batch settlement (multiple strategies)
- [ ] Settlement history API
- [ ] WebSocket notifications
- [ ] Admin dashboard for settlements
