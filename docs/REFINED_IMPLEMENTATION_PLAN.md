# Refined Implementation Plan: PolyHedge Strategy System

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the refined implementation plan for PolyHedge, focusing on a **strategy-based system** where users can buy pre-constructed hedging strategies instead of manually managing complex arbitrage strategies.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### **High-Level Flow:**

```
User on Arbitrum → StrategyManager (Arbitrum) → Bridge (Dual-chain)
    ↓                    ↓                           ↓              ↓
Buy Strategy       Execute GMX orders         Transfer USDC    Execute Polymarket
(pay USDC)         (on-chain, Arbitrum)       (Arbitrum→Poly)  orders (Polygon)
```

### **Networks:**
- **Arbitrum**: StrategyManager + HedgeExecutor (user funds, GMX hedging)
- **Polygon**: PolygonReceiver contract (Polymarket USDC settlement)
- **Off-chain Bridge Service**: 
  - Coordinates token transfers (LayerZero/Stargate)
  - Executes Polymarket orders on Polygon
  - Listens to events on both chains

## 📋 Component Breakdown

### **1. Setup Bot** 🤖

**Purpose:** Automated market scanning and strategy creation

**Responsibilities:**

- Scan Polymarket for overvalued/undervalued bets
- Run strategy constructor to form hedging combinations
- Deploy strategies to smart contract with private key management
- Monitor market conditions and update strategies

### **2. Smart Contract** 📜

**Purpose:** Fund management and strategy lifecycle (on Arbitrum)

**Core Functions:**
- Strategy creation and management
- User USDC deposit/withdrawal
- GMX hedge order coordination
- Settlement and payout distribution

### **3. Hedge Executor** 🌉

**Purpose:** On-chain GMX hedge order execution (on Arbitrum)

**Core Functions:**
- Receive hedge order data from StrategyManager
- Execute GMX perpetual orders directly on-chain
- Track hedge positions
- Close positions at maturity

### **4. Bridge/Executor** 🔗

**Purpose:** Cross-chain coordination for Polymarket settlement

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Listen to StrategyPurchased events on Arbitrum
- **Bridge USDC from Arbitrum to Polygon** (using LayerZero/Stargate)
- Execute Polymarket CLOB orders on Polygon (API)
- Monitor Polymarket positions
- Close positions at maturity on Polygon
- Compute realized PnL and call settleStrategy on Arbitrum
- Handle profit distribution back to Arbitrum

### **5. Frontend** 🖥️

**Purpose:** User interface and portfolio management (Polygon RPC)

**Key Pages:**

- Strategy Marketplace: Browse and buy strategies
- Dashboard: View owned positions and PNL
- Claim Interface: Claim mature strategies

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### **Strategy Creation Flow:**

```
1. Setup Bot scans markets
2. Bot identifies arbitrage opportunities
3. Bot constructs hedging strategies
4. Bot deploys strategies to smart contract
5. Strategies become available for purchase
```

### **Strategy Purchase Flow:**

```
1. User browses strategies on frontend (Arbitrum RPC)
2. User selects strategy and clicks "Buy"
3. User approves USDC spending (Arbitrum)
4. Smart contract processes purchase (StrategyManager on Arbitrum)
   - Takes net USDC from user (after 2% fee)
5. Contract emits StrategyPurchased event (Arbitrum)
6. HedgeExecutor receives order data and creates GMX orders on-chain (Arbitrum)
7. Bridge service listens for StrategyPurchased event:
   a. Initiates cross-chain token transfer: USDC (Arbitrum → Polygon)
   b. Receives USDC on PolygonReceiver contract (Polygon)
   c. Executes Polymarket orders on Polygon using bridged USDC
8. User position is now split across:
   - Arbitrum: GMX hedge position (tracked)
   - Polygon: Polymarket bet position (tracked)
```

### **Strategy Maturity & Settlement Flow:**

```
1. Strategy reaches maturity date on both chains
2. Bridge/backend orchestrates dual-chain settlement:
   
   On Polygon:
   a. Close Polymarket positions
   b. Collect final USDC balance
   c. Compute Polymarket PnL
   
   On Arbitrum:
   d. HedgeExecutor closes GMX positions
   e. Compute GMX hedge PnL
   
3. Aggregate total realized PnL across both positions
4. Calculate payoutPerUSDC = (principal + totalPnL) / principal
5. Bridge service transfers profits back to Arbitrum (if any)
6. Call settleStrategy(strategyId, payoutPerUSDC) on StrategyManager (Arbitrum)
7. User visits dashboard and claims mature strategy
8. Smart contract transfers total payout to user (USDC on Arbitrum)
```

## 📊 Missing Components & Recommendations

### **1. Security & Risk Management** ⚠️

**Missing:**

- Package validation and risk limits
- Bot private key security
- Bridge failure handling
- User fund protection

**Recommendations:**

```typescript
// Add to smart contract
contract SecurityManager {
    mapping(uint256 => bool) public validatedPackages;
    uint256 public maxPackageValue = 10000 * 1e6; // 10k USDC max

    function validatePackage(uint256 packageId) external onlyValidator {
        // Validate package risk parameters
        validatedPackages[packageId] = true;
    }
}
```

### **2. Monitoring & Analytics** 📈

**Missing:**

- Package performance tracking
- Bot health monitoring
- Bridge execution monitoring
- User analytics

**Recommendations:**

```typescript
// Add monitoring dashboard
class MonitoringDashboard {
  async trackPackagePerformance() {
    // Track package success rates
    // Monitor PNL distributions
    // Alert on anomalies
  }

  async monitorBotHealth() {
    // Check bot uptime
    // Monitor package creation frequency
    // Alert on failures
  }
}
```

### **3. Fee Management** 💰

**Missing:**

- Dynamic fee calculation
- Fee distribution logic
- Revenue tracking

**Recommendations:**

```solidity
// Add to smart contract
contract FeeManager {
    uint256 public baseFee = 200; // 2% base fee
    uint256 public performanceFee = 1000; // 10% performance fee

    function calculateFee(uint256 packageValue, uint256 expectedReturn)
        public view returns (uint256) {
        // Dynamic fee calculation based on risk/return
    }
}
```

### **4. Liquidity Management** 💧

**Missing:**

- Package size limits
- Liquidity impact assessment
- Slippage protection

**Recommendations:**

```python
# Add to bot
class LiquidityManager:
    def assessLiquidityImpact(self, package):
        # Check order book depth
        # Calculate expected slippage
        # Adjust package size if needed
        pass
```
