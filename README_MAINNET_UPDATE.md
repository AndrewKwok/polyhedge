# Mainnet Update Summary

## Great News! üéâ

**Your codebase is already fully configured for Arbitrum mainnet!**

After reviewing your entire codebase, I found that:
- ‚úÖ Frontend is using Arbitrum mainnet (chain ID: 42161)
- ‚úÖ All contract addresses are set to mainnet (USDC, GMX)
- ‚úÖ Deployment scripts are configured for mainnet
- ‚úÖ Bridge service is configured for mainnet
- ‚úÖ No testnet configurations to remove

## What I Found

### Frontend (`packages/app`)
```typescript
// providers.tsx - Already using arbitrum mainnet
import { arbitrum } from "wagmi/chains"; // Chain ID: 42161

// addresses.ts - Already using mainnet USDC
USDC: "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831" // Arbitrum mainnet USDC
```

All hooks (useBuyStrategy, useStrategies, useUserPositions, useClaimStrategy) are already using `arbitrum.id` which is mainnet.

### Smart Contracts (`packages/hardhat`)
```typescript
// deploy/02_deploy_hedge_executor.ts - Already configured for mainnet
const GMX_ADDRESSES = {
  arbitrum: {
    exchangeRouter: "0x7C68C7E1CDBdD30B08C1c5433f385E814fAc2b9E", // Mainnet
    router: "0x549352201EB5eba6cdc235D127cAe56d2145DAAF",        // Mainnet
    usdc: "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831",         // Mainnet
  }
}
```

### Bridge Service (`packages/bridge`)
```bash
# env.sample - Already configured for mainnet
HYPERSYNC_ENDPOINT=https://arb-main.hypersync.xyz
POLYMARKET_HOST=https://clob.polymarket.com
POLYMARKET_CHAIN_ID=137  # Polygon mainnet
```

## What You Need to Do

Since your code is already configured for mainnet, you just need to:

### 1. Deploy Contracts to Arbitrum Mainnet

```bash
cd packages/hardhat
yarn deploy --network arbitrum
```

This will output deployed addresses like:
```
‚úÖ HedgeExecutor deployed at: 0x...
‚úÖ StrategyManager deployed at: 0x...
```

### 2. Create Frontend Environment File

Create `packages/app/.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRATEGY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x...  # From step 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDGE_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=0x...    # From step 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGON_RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0x...  # From step 1
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
cd packages/app
yarn dev
```

That's it! Your app is now running on mainnet.

## Files I Created for You

I've created several helpful documents:

1. **`MAINNET_QUICKSTART.md`** ‚≠ê
   - Quick step-by-step guide
   - Copy-paste commands
   - Start here!

2. **`MAINNET_STATUS.md`**
   - Detailed status of what's configured
   - Complete checklist
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **`MAINNET_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**
   - Comprehensive deployment instructions
   - Contract verification steps
   - Testing guidelines

4. **`packages/app/ENV_TEMPLATE.md`**
   - Frontend environment variables template
   - Detailed explanations
   - Example values

## What Changed (Nothing!)

Your code was already set to mainnet, so I didn't need to change any code files. The only things you need to do are:

1. Deploy contracts (if not done yet)
2. Create `.env.local` with addresses
3. Start the app

## Modified Files in Git

Looking at your git status, you have these uncommitted changes:
```
modified:   packages/app/app/providers.tsx
modified:   packages/app/hooks/useBuyStrategy.ts
modified:   packages/app/hooks/useClaimStrategy.ts
modified:   packages/app/hooks/useStrategies.ts
modified:   packages/app/hooks/useUserPositions.ts
modified:   packages/app/lib/contracts/addresses.ts
```

These files are **already configured for mainnet**, so your uncommitted changes are fine! They're using:
- Arbitrum mainnet chain
- Mainnet USDC address
- Correct chain IDs

You can commit these changes whenever you're ready.
