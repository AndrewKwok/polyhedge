## Test Details

### 1. ✅ Should Execute Hedge Order on Strategy Purchase

**What it tests**: When a user buys a strategy, the hedge orders are automatically created on GMX.

**Setup**:

- Create strategy with 1 BTC short hedge order
- Alice buys strategy for 200 USDC

**Assertions**:

- Hedge order exists in HedgeExecutor
- Order details match (asset, direction, amount, slippage)
- Order is marked as executed

**Gas Usage**: ~159ms, 405-513k gas

---

### 2. ✅ Should Store GMX Order Key for Tracking

**What it tests**: GMX order keys are properly stored and can be used to track orders.

**Setup**:

- Create and buy strategy with hedge order

**Assertions**:

- GMX order key is not zero
- Strategy ID can be retrieved from GMX order key
- Enables cross-chain settlement tracking

**Key Feature**: Allows bridge service to map GMX orders back to strategies

---

### 3. ✅ Should Handle Multiple Hedge Orders for a Single Strategy

**What it tests**: Strategies can have multiple hedge orders.

**Setup**:

- Create strategy with 2 Polymarket orders + 2 hedge orders (BTC short + ETH long)

**Assertions**:

- All hedge orders are created on GMX
- Last hedge order is retrievable (current limitation)

**Known Limitation**: Current implementation stores only one hedge order per strategy. Subsequent orders overwrite previous ones. _(Should be fixed in future iterations with array storage)_

---

### 4. ✅ Should Track Hedge Order Status Correctly

**What it tests**: Hedge order execution status transitions properly.

**Setup**:

- Create strategy

**Flow**:

- Before purchase: `isOrderExecuted(1)` = false
- After purchase: `isOrderExecuted(1)` = true

**Assertions**:

- Proper state transitions
- Status reflects GMX execution

---

### 5. ✅ Should Reject Hedge Order Execution if Asset Not Configured

**What it tests**: Prevents execution of hedge orders for unconfigured assets.

**Setup**:

- Create strategy with hedge on unconfigured asset ("DOGE")
- Alice attempts to buy strategy

**Assertions**:

- Transaction reverts with "asset not supported"
- Prevents misconfiguration errors
- Assets must be whitelisted

**Security**: Ensures only configured markets are used

---

### 6. ✅ Should Handle Long and Short Hedge Orders

**What it tests**: Both long (directional up) and short (directional down) hedges work.

**Setup**:

- Strategy 1: BTC short hedge (0.5x leverage assumed)
- Strategy 2: ETH long hedge

**Assertions**:

- Long hedges: `isLong = true`
- Short hedges: `isLong = false`
- Both execute successfully

**Use Cases**:

- Short hedge for bullish Polymarket trades
- Long hedge for bearish Polymarket trades

---

### 7. ✅ Should Close Hedge Order and Track PnL

**What it tests**: Hedge orders can be closed at maturity with PnL tracking.

**Setup**:

- Buy strategy
- Wait for maturity

**Actions**:

- Call `closeHedgeOrder(strategyId, realizedPnL)`
- Track PnL (5 USDC profit in test)

**Assertions**:

- Order marked as closed
- PnL recorded

**Future**: PnL will be used for settlement calculations

---

### 8. ✅ Should Prevent Closing Already Closed Hedge Orders

**What it tests**: Prevents double-closing of hedge orders.

**Setup**:

- Buy strategy and wait for maturity

**Flow**:

- Close hedge order first time → success
- Close hedge order second time → revert

**Assertions**:

- First close succeeds
- Second close reverts with "already closed"

**Safety**: Prevents accidental double-closures

---

### 9. ✅ Should Support Different Slippage Tolerances

**What it tests**: Different strategies can have different slippage settings.

**Setup**:

- Strategy 1: Low slippage (0.5% = 50 bps)
- Strategy 2: High slippage (5% = 500 bps)

**Assertions**:

- Slippage settings are stored correctly
- GMX uses configured slippage per order

**Flexibility**: Allows traders to balance execution certainty vs. slippage

---

### 10. ✅ Complete Flow: Purchase → Hedge → Settlement → Claim

**What it tests**: End-to-end workflow including settlement and claim.

**Complete Flow**:

1. **Setup**
   - Create strategy with BTC short hedge
   - Fund HedgeExecutor with USDC

2. **Purchase** (Alice buys 200 USDC)
   - StrategyManager receives 200 USDC
   - 2% fee = 4 USDC
   - Net = 196 USDC invested

3. **Hedge Execution** (automatic)
   - HedgeExecutor receives hedge order
   - Calls GMX.createOrder()
   - Stores GMX order key

4. **Maturity** (fast-forward 70 seconds)
   - Close hedge order
   - Record 5 USDC profit

5. **Settlement**
   - StrategyManager.settleStrategy(payoutPerUSDC = 1.05)
   - Fund manager contract with profits

6. **Claim** (Alice withdraws)
   - Payout = 196 × 1.05 = 205.8 USDC
   - Alice receives 205.8 USDC
   - Profit = 9.8 USDC

**Assertions**:

- All stages execute correctly
- Final payout matches expected calculation

## Mock Contracts

### MockGMXExchangeRouter

**File**: `packages/hardhat/contracts/test/MockGMX.sol`

**Purpose**: Simulates GMX ExchangeRouter for testing

**Key Features**:

```solidity
function createOrder(
    address account,
    address[] calldata addressItems,
    uint256[] calldata uintItems,
    bytes32[] calldata bytesDataItems,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bytes32)
```

**Behavior**:

- Returns deterministic bytes32 order key
- Based on account, counter, and timestamp
- Allows order tracking in tests

### MockGMXRouter

**File**: `packages/hardhat/contracts/test/MockGMX.sol`

**Purpose**: Simulates GMX Router for approval logic

**Key Features**:

- `approvePlugin()` - Mock implementation
- `plugin()` - Returns mock address

## Gas Usage Analysis

### Deployment Costs

| Contract              | Gas       | % of Block |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| HedgeExecutor         | 1,444,655 | 4.8%       |
| StrategyManager       | 1,682,057 | 5.6%       |

## Test Architecture

### Setup Phase

```typescript
// Deploy mock contracts
MockGMXExchangeRouter
MockGMXRouter
MockERC20 (USDC)

// Deploy actual contracts
HedgeExecutor (with mock GMX)
StrategyManager (with HedgeExecutor)

// Configure
- Set StrategyManager in HedgeExecutor
- Configure asset markets (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- Fund users with USDC
- Fund HedgeExecutor with USDC
```

### Test Pattern

```typescript
async function testCase() {
  // Setup
  const { alice, manager, hedgeExecutor } = await deployFixture();

  // Create strategy
  await manager.createStrategy(name, fee, maturity, pmOrders, hedgeOrders, profit);

  // Execute
  await manager.connect(alice).buyStrategy(strategyId, amount);

  // Assert
  const hedgeOrder = await hedgeExecutor.getHedgeOrder(strategyId);
  expect(hedgeOrder.executed).to.equal(true);
}
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Multiple Hedge Orders Per Strategy

**Current**: Only the last hedge order is stored (overwrites previous)

**Impact**: Can't retrieve intermediate hedge orders

**Solution**: Use mapping with array:

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => HedgeOrder[]) public hedgeOrdersByStrategy;
```

### 2. Mock GMX Contracts

**Current**: Basic mock implementations

**Impact**: Doesn't simulate GMX execution failures

**Solution**: Add error simulation for negative testing

### 3. No Cross-Chain Testing

**Current**: All tests on single network

**Impact**: Bridge integration not fully tested

**Solution**: Add integration tests with bridge service
