# Strategy Guide: How PolyHedge Works

## 🎯 Overview

PolyHedge exploits pricing inefficiencies in Polymarket prediction markets while hedging directional risk through DEX perpetuals. This guide explains how the strategy works, why it's profitable, and how to implement it.

## 🧠 Core Strategy

### The Big Picture

1. **Find Mispriced Markets**: Use Black-Scholes theory to identify over/undervalued positions
2. **Create Arbitrage Positions**: Bet against overvalued markets, bet on undervalued markets
3. **Hedge Directional Risk**: Use DEX perpetuals to neutralize price exposure
4. **Profit from Convergence**: When prices move toward fair value, lock in profits

### Why This Works

**Market Inefficiencies**: Polymarket exhibits systematic pricing errors:

- **Tail strikes** (extreme prices) are overvalued due to hype and lottery mentality
- **Mid strikes** (realistic prices) are undervalued due to fear and risk aversion
- **These inefficiencies persist** because most traders don't use sophisticated pricing models

**Arbitrage Opportunity**: We can profit by:

- Selling overvalued positions (betting NO on tail strikes)
- Buying undervalued positions (betting YES on mid strikes)
- Hedging the net directional exposure

## 📊 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Market Scanning

**What We Do:**

- Monitor all Polymarket crypto markets in real-time
- Calculate theoretical fair prices using Black-Scholes barrier options
- Compare theoretical vs market prices to find inefficiencies

**Example:**

```
Market: "BTC > $150k by Oct 31, 2025"
Current BTC: $95,000
Market Price: 2.5% (people think 2.5% chance)
Theoretical Price: 0.22% (math says 0.22% chance)
Edge: -91.1% (market is 91% overvalued!)
Action: BET NO (sell the overvalued position)
```

### Step 2: Position Construction

**Spread Strategy:**
Instead of betting on individual markets, we create **spread positions**:

**Example Spread:**

- **NO on BTC >$150k** (overvalued by 91%)
- **YES on BTC >$110k** (undervalued by 358%)
- **Net result**: Profit if BTC ends between $110k-$150k

**Why Spreads Work:**

- Reduce directional risk
- Capture inefficiency on both sides
- More robust to price movements

### Step 3: Risk Hedging

**Delta Calculation:**

- Calculate the net delta exposure across all positions
- Hedge with DEX perpetuals to make portfolio delta-neutral

**Example:**

```
Position Delta: +0.15 (net long exposure)
Hedge: Short 0.15 BTC on GMX
Result: Delta-neutral portfolio
```

**Benefits:**

- Profit from arbitrage regardless of BTC price direction
- Reduce volatility and drawdowns
- More consistent returns

### Step 4: Execution

**Cross-Chain Automation:**

- Use Lit Protocol Vincent to bundle transactions
- Execute on Polygon (Polymarket) and Arbitrum (GMX) simultaneously
- One-click execution of complex multi-chain strategy

**Example Transaction:**

1. Buy YES shares on BTC >$110k (Polygon)
2. Sell YES shares on BTC >$150k (Polygon)
3. Open short position on GMX (Arbitrum)
4. All in one atomic transaction

### Step 5: Monitoring & Exit

**Continuous Monitoring:**

- Track position PNL in real-time
- Monitor for edge compression (inefficiencies disappearing)
- Adjust hedge ratios as needed

**Exit Conditions:**

- Edge drops below 5% threshold
- Time-based exit (near expiry)
- Manual override for risk management

## 💰 Profit Mechanics

### Where Profits Come From

**1. Arbitrage Edge**

- Exploit mispricings between theory and market
- Target 10-20% edge per position
- Multiple positions per epoch

**2. Time Decay**

- Options lose value as expiry approaches
- Benefit from selling overvalued positions
- Time works in our favor

**3. Volatility Mismatch**

- Market overestimates volatility for tail events
- Market underestimates volatility for realistic events
- Capture the difference

### Example Profit Calculation

**Position:**

- NO on BTC >$150k: $100 bet at 2.5% (overvalued by 91%)
- YES on BTC >$110k: $100 bet at 18% (undervalued by 358%)
- Hedge: Short 0.15 BTC on GMX

**Scenarios:**

- **BTC ends at $120k**: +$75 profit (spread pays out)
- **BTC ends at $140k**: +$25 profit (partial spread)
- **BTC ends at $160k**: -$25 loss (hedge protects)
- **BTC ends at $100k**: +$15 profit (hedge protects)

**Expected Return**: +$18 per $200 position (9% return)

## 🎯 Risk Management

### Position Sizing

**Kelly Criterion:**

- Calculate optimal position size based on edge and odds
- Use conservative fraction (25% of theoretical Kelly)
- Maximum 40% of capital per market

**Example:**

```
Edge: 20%
Win Probability: 70%
Kelly Fraction: 0.25 * (0.7 * 1.4 - 0.3) / 1.4 = 0.125
Position Size: 12.5% of capital
```

### Diversification

**Multiple Markets:**

- Spread risk across different assets (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- Different expiry dates
- Different strike prices

**Maximum Exposure:**

- Max 5 positions per epoch
- Max $5k per individual market
- Total portfolio limit: $100k initially

### Hedging Rules

**Delta Neutrality:**

- Maintain net delta exposure < 0.05
- Rebalance when delta exceeds threshold
- Use liquid perpetual markets (GMX, Hyperliquid)

**Hedge Ratios:**

- Calculate based on position deltas
- Account for correlation between markets
- Monitor and adjust dynamically

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Target Returns

**Per Epoch (1-4 weeks):**

- Target: 15-25% return
- Range: 5-40% (depending on opportunities)
- Win rate: 70%+ of epochs

**Annualized:**

- 200-300% APY (but with high volatility)
- Not compoundable due to epoch structure
- Better to think in terms of per-epoch returns

### Risk Metrics

**Volatility:**

- 20-30% per epoch (hedged reduces from 50%+)
- Sharpe ratio: 2-3 (excellent risk-adjusted)
- Max drawdown: -20% (rare, edge compression)

**Win/Loss Distribution:**

- 70% of epochs: +10% to +40%
- 20% of epochs: -5% to +10%
- 10% of epochs: -20% to -5%

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### What This Strategy IS

✅ **Statistical arbitrage** - Based on mathematical edge
✅ **Risk-managed** - Hedged against directional moves
✅ **Systematic** - Rules-based, not discretionary
✅ **Scalable** - Can handle multiple positions

### What This Strategy IS NOT

❌ **Risk-free** - Still has 10-20% loss scenarios
❌ **Guaranteed returns** - Depends on inefficiencies persisting
❌ **Passive income** - Requires active monitoring and execution
❌ **Simple hedging** - That approach produces negative returns

### Key Risks

**1. Edge Compression**

- As more people arbitrage, inefficiencies shrink
- Need to continuously find new opportunities
- May need to expand to other platforms

**2. Liquidity Constraints**

- Thin order books limit position sizes
- Slippage can eat into profits
- May need to scale gradually

**3. Execution Risk**

- Cross-chain complexity
- Oracle failures
- Smart contract bugs
- Gas cost volatility

**4. Market Risk**

- Extreme volatility events
- Correlation breakdown
- Regulatory changes

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### For Developers

**1. Build Theoretical Pricing Engine**

```python
# Calculate fair price for binary barrier option
theoretical_price = barrier_hit_probability(
    current_price=95000,
    target_price=150000,
    time_to_expiry=0.25,
    volatility=0.8
)
```

**2. Create Market Scanner**

```python
# Find arbitrage opportunities
opportunities = scanner.find_opportunities(
    min_edge=0.1,  # 10% minimum edge
    max_positions=5
)
```

**3. Implement Position Builder**

```python
# Create spread positions
spread = position_builder.create_spread(
    overvalued_markets=opportunities.overvalued,
    undervalued_markets=opportunities.undervalued
)
```

**4. Add Risk Hedging**

```python
# Calculate and execute hedge
delta = portfolio.calculate_net_delta()
hedge = hedging_engine.create_hedge(delta)
```
