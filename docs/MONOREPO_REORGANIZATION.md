# Monorepo Reorganization Summary

## 🎯 What Was Changed

The project has been successfully reorganized to follow a **proper monorepo structure** that aligns with the existing Scaffold-ETH 2 pattern.

## 📁 Before vs After

### Before (Inconsistent Structure)

```
polyhedge/
├── packages/
│   ├── hardhat/     # Smart contracts package
│   └── nextjs/      # Frontend package
├── src/             # Python code (inconsistent!)
│   ├── analysis/
│   ├── pricing/
│   └── ...
├── tests/           # Python tests (inconsistent!)
└── requirements.txt # Root Python deps
```

### After (Consistent Monorepo)

```

├── packages/
│   ├── hardhat/     # Smart contracts package
│   ├── nextjs/      # Frontend package
│   └── python/      # Python analysis package ✅

│       ├── requirements.txt
│       └── README.md
├── requirements.txt # References packages/python/requirements.txt
└── setup.sh        # Updated paths
```

## 🔄 Key Changes Made

### 1. **Moved Python Code to Packages**

- ✅ `src/` → `packages/python/`
- ✅ `tests/` → `packages/python/tests/`
- ✅ All Python modules now follow monorepo pattern

### 2. **Created Python Package Structure**

- ✅ `packages/python/package.json` - Package metadata
- ✅ `packages/python/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `packages/python/README.md` - Package documentation
- ✅ Proper `__init__.py` files for all modules

### 3. **Updated Root Configuration**

- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Now references `packages/python/requirements.txt`
- ✅ `setup.sh` - Updated paths to use `packages/python/`
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated documentation paths

### 4. **Updated Documentation**

- ✅ `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Reflects new monorepo structure
- ✅ All documentation now shows correct paths
- ✅ Development workflows updated

## 🎯 Benefits of Monorepo Structure

### 1. **Consistency**

- All packages follow the same structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand and navigate

### 2. **Scalability**

- Easy to add new packages (e.g., `packages/api/`, `packages/mobile/`)
- Each package can have its own dependencies and configuration
- Independent versioning and deployment

### 3. **Development Experience**

- Clear package boundaries
- Easy to work on specific components
- Consistent tooling across packages

### 4. **Hackathon Ready**

- Follows industry standard monorepo patterns
- Easy for team members to understand
- Professional project structure

## 📦 Package Structure

### **Hardhat Package** (`packages/hardhat/`)

- Smart contract development
- Deployment scripts
- Contract testing
- Hardhat configuration

### **Next.js Package** (`packages/nextjs/`)

- Frontend application
- React components
- Contract integration
- Next.js configuration

### **Python Package** (`packages/python/`)

- Mathematical analysis
- Market scanning
- Portfolio management
- Risk analysis
- Testing suite

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### **Full Stack Development**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start blockchain
yarn chain

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
yarn deploy

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
yarn start

# Terminal 4: Run Python analysis
cd packages/python
python analysis/verify_math.py
```

### **Package-Specific Development**

```bash
# Work on smart contracts
cd packages/hardhat
yarn test

# Work on frontend
cd packages/nextjs
yarn dev

# Work on Python analysis
cd packages/python
pytest tests/ -v
```

## 📊 File Organization

### **Root Level**

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `package.json` - Root package configuration
- `requirements.txt` - References Python package deps
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script
- `docs/` - Project documentation

### **Package Level**

Each package has its own:

- `package.json` - Package-specific configuration
- `README.md` - Package documentation
- Dependencies and configuration
- Tests and scripts

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **For Development**

1. **Set up environment:**

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Work on specific packages:**

   ```bash
   # Smart contracts
   cd packages/hardhat

   # Frontend
   cd packages/nextjs

   # Python analysis
   cd packages/python
   ```

3. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   # Contract tests
   yarn hardhat:test

   # Python tests
   cd packages/python && pytest tests/ -v
   ```

### **For Hackathon**

- Clear package boundaries make it easy to assign team members
- Each package can be developed independently
- Easy to demo specific components
- Professional structure for judges
