# PolyHedge Project Overview

## 🎯 Mission Statement

PolyHedge is an automated arbitrage platform that exploits pricing inefficiencies in Polymarket crypto price prediction markets while hedging directional risk through DEX perpetuals. Our mission is to democratize sophisticated trading strategies that were previously only available to institutional traders.

## 🚀 Core Value Proposition

### The Problem We Solve

**Polymarket Crypto Price Inefficiencies**: Despite $2B+ daily volume, Polymarket exhibits significant pricing inefficiencies in crypto price prediction markets:

- **Extreme price targets** (BTC >$200k) are massively overvalued due to hype
- **Mid-range targets** (BTC >$110k) are undervalued due to fear
- **Manual arbitrage** is complex, risky, and time-consuming
- **Cross-chain execution** is manual and error-prone

**Current Solutions Are Inadequate**:

- No automated tools for detecting crypto price inefficiencies
- Cross-chain execution is manual and error-prone
- Risk management requires sophisticated knowledge
- No integrated hedging solutions

### Our Solution

**Automated Arbitrage + Hedging Platform**:

1. **Real-time scanner** identifies mispriced crypto markets using Black-Scholes theory
2. **One-click execution** creates arbitrage positions across chains
3. **Automated hedging** neutralizes directional risk via DEX perpetuals (GMX)
4. **Smart risk management** with Kelly Criterion position sizing

## 📊 Market Opportunity

### Current Inefficiencies (BTC Price Predictions)

| Market     | Market Price | Theoretical | Edge       | Opportunity                |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| BTC >$200k | 0.7%         | 0.0001%     | **-99.9%** | Massive overvaluation      |
| BTC >$150k | 2.5%         | 0.22%       | **-91.1%** | High overvaluation         |
| BTC >$110k | 18.0%        | 82.4%       | **+358%**  | Extreme undervaluation     |
| BTC >$120k | 12.0%        | 31.9%       | **+166%**  | Significant undervaluation |

### Expected Returns

- **Target**: 15-25% per epoch (1-4 weeks)
- **Mechanism**: Exploit crypto price prediction mispricings
